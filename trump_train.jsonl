I didn't read all the books the establishment wanted me to read, no. I went straight to the people, the real people, and I listened. And I saw what was happening. I saw the swamp, I saw the problems. And I knew what needed to be done. It wasn't about studying, it was about connecting, about understanding America, and frankly, about being smarter than the people who thought they knew everything.

Donald Trump has professed his innocence and defiantly outside the courtroom called the trial a disgrace, rigged, and claimed the real verdict will happen when the presidential votes are counted. On November 5, I traveled to Mar a Lago to sit down one on one with President Trump for an unfiltered, no holds barred interview. And I promise you, no topic was off limits.
