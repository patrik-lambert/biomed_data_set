Q: Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer?\nA: No. Rationale: The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs.
Q: Is translocation t ( 11 ; 18 ) ( q21 ; q21 ) predictive of response to chemotherapy with 2CdA in patients with gastric MALT lymphoma?\nA: No. Rationale: Our findings suggest that the presence of the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript resulting from t(11;18)(q21;q21) does not adversely affect the response of gastric.
Q: Do mild and moderate hypothermia ( alpha-stat ) impair the coupling between local cerebral blood flow and metabolism in rats?\nA: No. Rationale: Anesthesia and hypothermia induce divergent changes in mean CBF and CGU.
Q: Does surgical approach influence the outcome of incidental gallbladder carcinoma?\nA: No. Rationale: These results would seem to lend support to the opinion that LC does not worsen the prognosis for incidental GC, regardless of.
Q: Is familial early-onset diabetes a typical MODY in several Tunisian patients?\nA: No. Rationale: A molecular defect in known MODY genes has been excluded in 11 patients with early-onset diabetes suggesting that other genetic causes may.
Q: Does tyrosinemia I , a model for human diseases mediated by 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases : hepatotoxin suppression by NTBC normalize hepatic collagen metabolism?\nA: No. Rationale: Normalization of hepatic collagen formation, highly desirable in all fibrotic liver diseases, is not achieved by NTBC in tyrosinemia I.
Q: Do clinical and hematologic features reliably identify children with unsuspected meningococcal disease?\nA: No. Rationale: Children ultimately diagnosed with meningococcal disease have commonly been evaluated as outpatients and discharged to home before diagnosis.
Q: Does increased lung water without hypocapnia cause central sleep apnoea in a lamb model?\nA: No. Rationale: These results support the view that hypocapnia is essential for CSA, and demonstrated that increased EVLW causes tachypnoea but not CSA.
Q: Is metformin-induced thyrotropin suppression associated with cardiac effects?\nA: No. Rationale: Our results show that the TSH-suppressive effect observed in patients taking metformin is not associated with peripheral markers of thyroid hormone excess.
Q: Do reductions in blood pressure following energy restriction for weight loss rebound after re-establishment of energy balance in overweight and obese subjects?\nA: No. Rationale: The hypotensive effects of caloric restriction do not rebound upon return to eucaloric intake at a reduced body weight, and a high.
Q: Is ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization supported by environmental differences among species in a cosmopolitan grass genus?\nA: No. Rationale: Our results suggest that these commonly held hypotheses about the effects of polyploidization on ecological distributions are not universally applicable.
Q: Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy.
Q: Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: It is often assumed that midwives in rural areas where there are fewer deliveries, will be less competent and confident in their.
Q: Should HIV-infected patients be screened for silent myocardial ischaemia using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: In male HIV-infected patients older than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using myocardial SPECT was.
Q: Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information.
Q: CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea: does it offer a better quality of life and sleep?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely.
Q: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems.
Q: Is it Crohn's disease?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis.
Q: Are lifetime prevalence of impetigo, molluscum and herpes infection really increased in children having atopic dermatitis?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: The lifetime prevalence of IC was indeed higher in young children with a history of AD.
Q: Does government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.
Q: Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion: are they different diseases?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary.
Q: Do older patients receive adequate stroke care?\nA: Uncertain. Rationale: Older patients were less likely to receive diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice than younger patients.
Q: Is aPOE ε2 allele associated with larger regional cortical thicknesses and volumes?\nA: Yes. Rationale: The APOE ε2 allele is associated with larger regional cortical thicknesses and volumes in mild cognitive impairment and AD.
Q: Does the PARsylation activity of tankyrase in adipose tissue modulate systemic glucose metabolism in mice?\nA: Yes. Rationale: Systemic glucose homeostasis is regulated by the PARsylation activity of TNKS in adipocytes.
Q: Does specific binding of hypochlorite-oxidized HDL to platelet CD36 trigger proinflammatory and procoagulant effects?\nA: Yes. Rationale: From these results we conclude that specific binding of hyp-OxHDL to platelet CD36 is essential for the proinflammatory and procoagulant effects of.
Q: Does azimilide reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in a placebo-controlled clinical trial?\nA: Yes. Rationale: Azimilide significantly reduces the number of ED visits and hospitalizations in patients with an ICD at high risk of arrhythmias.
Q: Does interferon induce insulin resistance in patients with chronic active hepatitis C?\nA: Yes. Rationale: These results indicate that interferon therapy for 2 weeks induces insulin resistance in the splanchnic, as well as peripheral tissues, in patients.
Q: Does yeast strain affect phenolic concentration in Pinot noir wines made by microwave maceration with early pressing?\nA: Yes. Rationale: The novel winemaking process produced Pinot noir wine that was stable 37 days after fruit had been harvested and yeast strain choice.
Q: Does influence of the organization of binary mix on their compactibility?\nA: Yes. Rationale: This study clearly demonstrates the influence of the organization of binary mixes on their compactibility.
Q: Does cell-specific PPARγ deficiency establish anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic properties for this nuclear receptor in non-parenchymal liver cells?\nA: Yes. Rationale: These data unveil anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles for PPARγ in non-parenchymal liver cells.
Q: Do increased speed and image quality in single-shot fast spin echo imaging via variable refocusing flip angles?\nA: Yes. Rationale: vrfSSFSE increases speed at 3T over conventional SSFSE via reduced SAR, and when combined with full-Fourier acquisition can improve image quality, although.
Q: Do aging mesenchymal stem cells fail to protect because of impaired migration and antiinflammatory response?\nA: Yes. Rationale: Taken together, the decreased expression of cytokine and chemokine receptors in aged B-MSCs compromises their protective role by perturbing the potential of.
Q: Are enhancement of muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and alterations in insulin action lipid species dependent : potent tissue-specific effects of medium-chain fatty acids?\nA: Yes. Rationale: MCFAs reduce adiposity and preserve insulin action in muscle and adipose, despite inducing steatosis and insulin resistance in the liver.
