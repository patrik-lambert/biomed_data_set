I've talked to the border guards down there, Brandon Judd. I've talked to Jason Jones. I've talked to the people that actually know the numbers. They say it's between ten and 13 million.

We had many murderers, 11,888. They think some murdered more than one person. So you had murderers coming in. You had everybody coming in, and not just South America, from all over the world. They were emptying their prisons into our country, and now it's totally closed down. And you've seen, just Yesterday they announced 99.9%. Nobody thought that could happen. And it Happened quickly, very quickly. And I think that's very significant. But we're doing other things that are very significant.

And when I put the tariffs on, very substantial tariffs, although peanuts compared to what people do to us, what countries do to us, it became a very, very powerful, successful company. Now, let's say I didn't do the tariffs. It would have gone out of business. You would have lost tens of thousands of jobs. And you don't include that in your equation. No, they make a lot of money. I'll go a step further. Tariffs are going to make our country rich. Tariffs are going to help US pay off $35 trillion in debt. Tariffs are going to make our country safe because China, as an example, doesn't want to play games with us. If we're going to do tariffs on them, they don't want to play games.

I said, tell me, why did they have me down so much? I mean, nobody's gonna believe them the next time. They said they don't care. When you're down 17 points, people are gonna stay home. They're not gonna vote because they're gonna say, I love Trump, but I'm not gonna waste my time. It's cold out. I said, but why don't they make it four or five?

And I had a lot of tariffs on a lot of different countries, but in particular China, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and we had no inflation. In fact, when I handed it over, they didn't have inflation for a year and a half. They wanted almost two years just based on what I had created. And then they created inflation with energy and with spending too much. So I think we will. I'm a big believer in tariffs. I think tariffs are the most beautiful word. I think they're beautiful. It's going to make us rich. We're subsidizing Canada to the tune of over $100 billion a year. We're subsidizing Mexico for almost $300 billion. We shouldn't be subsidizing. Why are we subsidizing these countries? If we're going to subsidize them, let it become a state. We're subsidizing Mexico and we're subsidizing Canada, and we're subsidizing many countries all over the world. And all I want to do is I want to have a level, fast but fair playing field."}]}

It would have been a lot easier before it started. Essentially, for four years, I kept them from doing anything. Because you know what? I will tell you this. I've never said this. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. I said, don't ever do it. Don't ever do it. He would have never done it. But again, oil prices, he wouldn't have done it because of me. But oil prices, the prices were so high that he had so much money. So he had all this money to prosecute the war. The one who drove up the prices was Biden."}]}
